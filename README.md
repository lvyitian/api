# Okyanus API

This is the API you should depend on when you're making Okyanus mods.

This "project" only contains the interface descriptions, as the implementations
might be in either [okyanus-loader](https://github.com/okyanus-mc/loader) or 
[Okyanus Runtime](https://github.com/okyanus-mc/runtime) depending on context.
